      # We build all ahead of time before linting as we need the build
      # step for TS type definitions to be usable. These are used during both
      # linting and testing.
      # Even more, we need to build the two specific ones first as their type
      # definitions are required for the other project builds.
      # TODO(byk): Streamline this a bit and run the rest of the build in parallel

## Publishing

This repo is published using [Craft](https://github.com/getsentry/craft).

You need to set the following environment variables to be able to work with Craft:

1. `GITHUB_TOKEN`: [Create a personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo&description=Craft) from GitHub with `repo` permissions and set the token value to this env variable
2. `NPM_TOKEN`: Create an automation token from NPM by visiting https://www.npmjs.com/settings/<npm_user>/tokens/new and select **Automation** as the token type.

Then all you need to do is `yarn workspace @formsort/<package> run release <version>` from the repo root or `yarn release <version>` from the package directory you want to release. We'll take it from there :)

# @formsort/embed-messaging-manager

This package is used internally by Formsort to manage messaging between the embed and the parent page or application.

Not intended to be used directly. You're probably looking for:

- [@formsort/web-embed-api](../web-embed-api) if you want to embed Formsort in a web page.
- [@formsort/react-embed](../web-embed-api) if you want to embed Formsort embed in a react application.
